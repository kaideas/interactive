			</p>

			</p>

			<p class="listcontent">
				The website you use will ask for the number to which you wish to fax (without spaces), as well as the name of the recipient, the subject of the fax, an email address for verification that the fax was sent, and your name. Other information might be required as well.
			</p>
			
			<ul>

			</li>
			</ul>

		<li>
			<img src="images/04.jpg">
			<p class="listhead">
				Attach the image you wish to fax.
			</p>
			<p class="listcontent">
				If you don't have the image downloaded on your computer, do so by scanning it in, or taking a photo and transferring it to the computer. (If you have a camera phone, you can take a photo of the page and email it to yourself, then download from there.)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
