    <h1><a href="index.html"><img src="home.svg"></a>&nbsp;Purpose of Copying</h1>
    <p>One of the best ways to learn how to do something is by observing and imitating others who have done it before. This is true for all kinds of fields. People often learn how to play sports by emulating their idols who they watch on TV, from basic fundamentals to extra flourishesâ€”tongue-wags, fist pumps, celebrations. Growing up as a cellist, I was encouraged to listen to the recording of whatever piece I was working on as much as possible, in order to hear how a professional translated static symbols on the page to continuous, nuanced music. By copying others who have done it before, you get a sense of what elements and rules are essential and what things you can vary to your own tastes and preferences.
